This project implements a Mask Detection System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify whether a person is wearing a mask or not. 
It is designed to help monitor compliance with mask mandates in public places and enhance health and safety measures, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Features:
Image Classification: The model predicts whether a person is wearing a mask or not.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):
The architecture leverages CNN to extract features from images and make accurate predictions.
Training on Custom Dataset: 
The model is trained on a custom dataset containing images of people with and without masks.
High Accuracy: 
The model is optimized for accuracy and can achieve real-time mask detection.

Technologies Used:
Python: The main programming language.
TensorFlow/Keras: Used for building and training the CNN model.
OpenCV: For image processing and data augmentation.
NumPy/Pandas: For data manipulation and handling.
Matplotlib: For visualizing the training process and results.
Dataset:
The model uses a dataset of images labeled as "Mask" and "No Mask". 
You can use publicly available datasets or create your own custom dataset to train the model. 
The dataset should contain images of individuals, with clear differentiation between those wearing masks and those without.
